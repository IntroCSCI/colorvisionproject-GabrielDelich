# !!!Palette Analyzer!!!

#My program takes all the colors from the file and prints them out

!!!Replace with a description of what your program does!!!

### Now my program counts all the colors in the file and prints them out

*Coming soon*

### Hopefully soon I can find the unique values in the file and tell how many unique colors there are

*Coming soon*


## Developer

Gabriel Delich

## Example

To run the program, give the following commands:

```
example.css
```

Here is an example of the program running:

```
#ffffff;color: #ffffff;color: #404040;color: #bfbfbf;color:inherit;
There are 1068 unique colors in this file
```

## C++ Guide

### Variables and Data Types

We use a multiple array of variables and data types to achieve what the program does.
We use string to store inputs from the user, and to store data that was in a file
We use size_t to find the position of color in our file

### Console Input and Output

We prompt the user to enter in a file name which then opens up the file and outputs all the data that has 'color' within the file

### Decisions

Using if statments in my code to find where in a file there is the word 'color' and then if there is printing out the word next to it.
I also use else to cover if the user doesnt inpout a valid file by saying 'Could not be opened'

### Iteration


What I originally set out to do was have a loop that went through the text file and stored all the data that was unique within that file.
Couldnt figure out how to do that.

### File Input and Output
We prompt the user to enter in a file name which then opens up the file and outputs all the data that has 'color' within the file
